# TEAM-GM4-Predict
**Version Control repository for Advanced Regression Predict (TEAM GM4):**

In this project, we model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources - for the country of Spain. The daily shortfall, which will be referred to as the target variable, will be modelled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as pressure, wind speed, humidity, etc.

The data used for this project is contained in the df_test.csv and df_train.csv files. The data analysis and modeling is done in TeamGM4FinalNotebook.ipynb
